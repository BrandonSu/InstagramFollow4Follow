# InstagramFollow4Follow
Checks to see if the people you're following follow you back! As of now, I have no knowledge of web scraping so the user must copy paste their followers and following into a file thats located in the same directory as the java file. The Insta.java file then will print out to the screen the list of accounts the user follows that don't follow the user back
